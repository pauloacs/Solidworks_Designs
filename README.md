# Solidworks_Designs

Design of a chainsaw using as a support a physical chainsaw. Its componentes were measured using a paquimeter and a coarse representation of each one was done while learning to use SoliWorks. 

Besides the geometric representations, an animation of the mechanism was done. 

In the process the above cover was not done, as can be seen in the next picture.
